# MDPGRP19

MDP is a Multi-Disciplinary Project whereby I worked together with a group of 8 students to build a robot that can go through a maze without hitting the obstacles. 5 components needed to come into synchronization for this project to be a success - STM (Hardware), Algorithm (Software), Raspberry Pi (Brain/Computer), Android (Tablet) and Image Recognition (Capture images). 

The first task was to be able to go through a maze with 6 obstacles, and we have to find the shortest path to reach each of the 6 obstacles, and capture and predict the image on each obstacle correctly.

The second task was to be able to go through 2 obstacles, with each obstacle having an image that points to the left or right, and the robot can capture, predict and move in the correct direction, before returning to its carpark safely.
